# Chicken Liver Parfait

## Ingredients

- 200g shallots, finely sliced
- 2 cloves of garlic, finely sliced
- 100ml brandy
- 100ml ruby port
- 100ml madeira
- a sprig of thyme
- a fresh bay leaf
- 1/8 tsp allspice

- 3 eggs
- 7g salt

## Equipment

## Method

- Make a reduction by adding 50g of butter, the shallots, garlic, herbs, allspice and alcohol to a small saucepan.
- Set on a low heat and allow to gently reduce for 2-3 hours, until the oil separates out. Add small splashes of water if needed to stop sticking.
- When finished, place in a bowl to cool slightly.
- Turn the oven on to 100C and set up a bain-marie by filling the large baking tray with boiling water. You should have enough water to come about halfway up the terrine mould.
- Melt the remaining 150g of butter.
- Add the shallot reduction, eggs, livers and salts to the blender and blend to combine.
- Add the melted butter and blend thourougly.
- Pour the parfait mix through a fine sieve into the terrine mould.
- Cover the top of the terrine mould tightly with foil and place into the bain-marie.
- Cook until the internal temperature reaches 64C, approx 30 minutes
- Remove from the bain-marie and let cool to room temperature before covering with clingfilm and storing in the fridge.
