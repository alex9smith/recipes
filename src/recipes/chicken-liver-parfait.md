# Chicken Liver Parfait with Spiced Port Jelly

## Ingredients

### For the parfait

- 200g shallots, finely sliced
- 2 cloves of garlic, finely sliced
- 100ml brandy
- 100ml ruby port
- 100ml madeira
- a sprig of thyme
- a fresh bay leaf
- 1/8 tsp allspice
- 200g butter
- 300g chicken livers
- 3 eggs
- 7g salt
- 2g pink curing salt

### For the port jelly

- 50ml cold water
- 6g gelatin powder
- 250ml ruby port
- 1 star anise
- 1 cinnamon stick

## Equipment

Terrine mould or similar small ovenproof dish
Large baking tray with high sides
High powered blender
Fine sieve

## Method

- Make a reduction by adding 50g of butter, the shallots, garlic, herbs, allspice and alcohol to a small saucepan.
- Set on a low heat and allow to gently reduce for 2-3 hours, until the oil separates out. Add small splashes of water if needed to stop sticking.
- When finished, place in a bowl to cool slightly.
- Turn the oven on to 100C and set up a bain-marie by filling the large baking tray with boiling water. You should have enough water to come about halfway up the terrine mould.
- Melt the remaining 150g of butter.
- Add the shallot reduction, eggs, livers and salts to the blender and blend to combine.
- Add the melted butter and blend thourougly.
- Pour the parfait mix through a fine sieve into the terrine mould.
- Cover the top of the terrine mould tightly with foil and place into the bain-marie.
- Cook until the internal temperature reaches 64C, approx 30 minutes
- Remove from the bain-marie and let cool to room temperature.
- While the parfait is cooling, make the jelly. Put the gelatin and cold water in a small bowl and leave for 10 minutes to bloom.
- Meanwhile put the port and spices in a small saucepan and gently warm. We want this warm enough to infuse the spices and dissolve the gelatin but not boiling as that will ruin the gelatin.
- Mix the gelatin powder and water into the warm port and stir well to combine.
- Remove the whole spices and gently pour the jelly onto the parfait to form a 1mm layer.
- Allow to fully cool to room temperature then tightly wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate.
