# Piña Colada Ice Cream

## Ingredients

- 500g pineapple (I use frozen)
- 1 can full fat coconut milk
- 60g dark brown sugar
- 60g granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon lime juice

## Equipment

- Ice cream machine
- Blender or food processor

## Method

- Blend the pineapple and lime juice until completely smooth. You may need to add a splash of water or pineapple juice but try to add as little as possible.
- Pour the pineapple juice into a large container with a lid, add all the other ingredients and mix well until all the sugar has dissolved.
- Put the mixture in the fridge and let chill overnight.
- Churn in an ice cream machine.
- Return the ice cream to the container with a lid and put it in the freezer to set for at least 6 hours.
