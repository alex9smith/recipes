# Halloween pumpkin bread with chocolate streusel

## Ingredients

### For the bread

- 200g self raising flour
- 1/8 tsp table salt
- 1 tsp tumeric powder
- 3/4 tsp cinnamon powder
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- a pinch of ground cloves
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 100g granulated sugar
- 50g demarara sugar
- 225g pumpkin puree (half a can)
- 100g vegetable oil

### For the streusel

- 65g self raising flour
- 55g demarara sugar
- 3 tablespoons cocoa powder
- 1/8 tsp table salt
- 75g butter or vegetable shortening cut into 1cm cubes

## Equipment

Loaf tin lined with baking paper
2 mixing bowls

## Method

- Preheat the oven to 180 C
- In one bowl, mix all the ingredients for the streusel apart from the butter
- Rub the butter in using your fingers until the mixture is sticky and all looks wet. You'll know when it's finished
- In the other bowl, make the bread batter. Whisk the sugar and eggs together until the mixture lightens and increases in volume slightly
- Keep whisking and stream in the oil slowly
- Add the pumpkin puree, spices, salt, and vanilla and mix thoroughly
- Whisk in the flour
- Pour the batter into the prepared loaf tin
- Press the streusel firmly into the top of the batter, covering the whole top
- Bake for 45 - 60 minutes

## Notes

This is mostly Claire Saffitz's recipe as demonstrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqQdYoJSFx4), but with the ingredients and measures adapted for the UK.
