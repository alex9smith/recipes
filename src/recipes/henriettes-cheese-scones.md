# Henriette's Cheese Scones

## Ingredients

- 500g plain flour
- 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 4 tsp cream of tartare
- 50g diced cold unsalted butter
- 25g Trex (or another 75g butter)
- 1/2 tsp mustard powder
- 300ml milk
- 200g grated cheddar or similar hard cheese
- 1 egg

## Method

- Preheat your oven to 220 C
- Put all the dry ingredients, butter and Trex in a food processor and pulse until the fat is incorporated
- Add all the milk and pulse a few more times to mix
- Tip the dough out onto a floured surface and knead lightly until it comes together
- Roll out to about 3cm thickness
- Dip a 3cm cutter in flour and stamp out as many scones as you can
- Reroll the scraps and stamp out the rest
- Place the scones on a lined baking sheet, beat the egg and brush the tops
- Bake for 10 minutes
- Turn the oven down to 200 C and bake for another 10 minutes, until golden brown
- Move the scones to a wire rack and allow to cool for 10 minutes before eating

## Notes

These freeze very well in a freezer bag and last for months.
Reheat in the toaster or (briefly) in the microwave on low power.
