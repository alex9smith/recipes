# Henriette's Cheese Scones

## Ingredients

- 500g plain flour
- 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 4 tsp cream of tartare
- 50g diced cold unsalted butter
- 25g Trex (or another 75g butter)
- 1/2 tsp mustard powder
- 300ml milk
- 200g grated cheddar or similar hard cheese
- 1 egg

## Method

1. Preheat your oven to 220 C.
2. Put all the dry ingredients, butter and Trex in a food processor and pulse until the fat is incorporated.
3. Add all the milk and pulse a few more times to mix.
4. Tip the dough out onto a floured surface and knead lightly until it comes together.
5. Roll out to about 3cm thickness.
6. Dip a 3cm cutter in flour and stamp out as many scones as you can.
7. Reroll the scraps and stamp out the rest.
8. Place the scones on a lined baking sheet, beat the egg and brush the tops.
9. Bake for 10 minutes.
10. Turn the oven down to 200 C and bake for another 10 minutes, until golden brown.
11. Move the scones to a wire rack and allow to cool for 10 minutes before eating.

## Notes

These freeze very well in a freezer bag and last for months.
Reheat in the toaster or (briefly) in the microwave on low power.
