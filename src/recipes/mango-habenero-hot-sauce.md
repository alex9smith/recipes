# Mango Habenero Hot Sauce

## Ingredients

- 850g jar of mango puree
- 3 habaneros
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 2cm of ginger
- 1 tsp lime juice
- 2 tsp rice vinegar

## Method

1. Peel and finely slice the garlic and ginger.
2. Deseed the chillies and cut into roughly 1cm squares.
3. Heat 2 tsp of neutral oil in a stainless steel saucepan over medium low heat.
4. Fry the chillies and ginger with a pinch of salt until starting to soften and the oil is turning red, about 2 minutes.
5. Add the ginger and continue to fry until the ginger and garlic are starting to brown, 1-2 more minutes.
6. Add the tin of mango puree and stir through.
7. Bring the sauce up to a simmer and stir regularly for 10 minutes until the aromatics are soft enough to blend.
8. Turn off the heat and allow to cool for 10 minutes.
9. Blend the sauce well with a stick blender.
10. Stir in the lime juice and vinegar.
11. Allow to cool to room temperature before bottling.

## Notes

The sauce will keep for a few months in the fridge and it's better after at least 1 week.

Three chillies makes this very spicy.
It does mellow as it gets older, but add more or less chilli to your liking.

This recipe is designed to emphasise the floral fruitiness of habeneros.
You could substitute for a milder chilli as long as it has a good flavour.
