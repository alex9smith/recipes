# Bacon

## Ingredients

Ingredients for this recipe are given as ratios so it works for any quantity of pork belly.

- 100% pork belly, skin off. At least 1.5kg
- 2.25% kosher salt
- 0.25% pink curing salt
- 2% brown sugar
- 5% or greater spices

## Method

- Mix the salts, sugar and spices well in a small bowl
- Cover pork belly all over in the salt mixture, making sure to use it all
- Put pork belly in a baking tray, cover with cling film and put in fridge
- Leave for 7-10 days, turning every 2 days
- Uncover and leave for another 2 days in the fridge to dry out
- Smoke on bbq, as low and slow as possible (at least 90 minutes) turning every 15 minutes
- Wrap in cling film and foil and put back in fridge overnight to set
- Put in the freezer for 45 minutes before slicing

## Notes

Make sure you use all of the salt mixture - this is important to have a safe amount of curing salt in the end product

It's easiest to slice the bacon with the fat side down on the chopping board

Any combination of spices will work!
In the past I've done gin and tonic (lemon, black pepper, juniper and coriander) and mince pie (orange, apple, cinnamon, clove), both of which were excellent.
